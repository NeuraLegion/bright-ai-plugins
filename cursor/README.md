# Bright Security — Cursor plugin

Bright DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) agents and skills, packaged for Cursor.
The plugin wires two orchestration agents and six skills to the **Bright MCP server**, so Cursor
can analyze an app, reach a target, register attack surface, run scans, and remediate findings —
in desktop Cursor or in Cursor Cloud Agents.

## What's inside
- **Agents** (`agents/`)
  - `bright-application-testing` — analyze the repo, reach the target, configure Bright, register
    attack surface, and run DAST scans (through a Repeater for private/local targets).
  - `bright-remediation-loop` — reproduce findings with DAST, apply minimal fixes, restart the
    app, and re-run validation scans until findings are gone.
- **Skills** (`skills/`) — `analyze-codebase`, `setup-repeater`, `setup-auth`,
  `register-entrypoints`, `run-scan`, `fix-and-validate`. The agents call these as building blocks.
- **MCP** (`mcp.json`) — the Bright MCP server over HTTP.

## Install

**1. Export your Bright credentials** in the shell/user environment (the MCP server and the Bright
Repeater both read them):

```bash
echo 'export BRIGHT_HOSTNAME="app.brightsec.com"' >> ~/.zshrc   # your Bright cluster hostname
echo 'export BRIGHT_TOKEN="your-bright-api-token"' >> ~/.zshrc  # your Bright API token
source ~/.zshrc
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("BRIGHT_HOSTNAME", "app.brightsec.com", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("BRIGHT_TOKEN", "your-bright-api-token", "User")
```

**2. Add the marketplace and install the plugin.** Cursor installs plugins from the app, not from
the CLI. Add the marketplace source (once), then install from **Customize**:

```bash
# Add the marketplace source (CLI can add a marketplace, but not install a plugin)
cursor-agent plugin marketplace add https://github.com/NeuraLegion/bright-ai-plugins
```

Then in desktop Cursor open **Customize → Plugins**, find **Bright Security** under the `brightsec`
marketplace, and click **Install**. You can also browse and install from
[cursor.com/marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace).

**3. Enable the MCP server.** After install, confirm the **brightsec** MCP server is enabled in
Customize (or Cursor Settings → MCP), and that the two Bright agents appear.

## Use

Ask for an agent in chat — Cursor delegates to it based on the task:

```
Use the bright-application-testing agent to scan this app
Use the bright-remediation-loop agent to scan, fix, and re-verify
```

You can also pick the agent explicitly from Cursor's agent selector. Scan any target you own or are
authorized to test (local, staging, or another authorized environment). Reach private/local targets
through a Repeater — the agent sets one up for you.

## Advanced usage & options

### Use without installing

Load the plugin straight from a clone — handy for trying it out, pinning a commit, or CI.
`BRIGHT_HOSTNAME` and `BRIGHT_TOKEN` still need to be in the environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeuraLegion/bright-ai-plugins
```

**Option A — CLI, single session.** The `--plugin-dir` flag loads a local plugin directory for one
run, with no marketplace and no install:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
cd /path/to/your-project
cursor-agent --plugin-dir /path/to/bright-ai-plugins/cursor
```

**Option B — desktop Cursor, local plugin folder.** Symlink the plugin into Cursor's local plugin
directory, then reload:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/bright-ai-plugins/cursor ~/.cursor/plugins/local/bright-security
```

Restart Cursor (or run **Developer: Reload Window**) and the agents, skills, and MCP server load
without a marketplace install.

### MCP secrets in the CLI

The CLI keeps it simple: it reads `mcp.json` (from the plugin, or from `.cursor/mcp.json` /
`~/.cursor/mcp.json`) and resolves `${env:BRIGHT_HOSTNAME}` and `${env:BRIGHT_TOKEN}` straight from
the shell it runs in. No dashboard configuration is involved, and the Bright Repeater picks up the
same exported variables — one source of truth for both. (`envFile` is stdio-only, so it doesn't
apply to the Bright HTTP MCP server; use shell environment variables.)

Approve the MCP server so the CLI loads it without prompting:

```bash
# One-off: approve all MCP servers for this run
cursor-agent --plugin-dir /path/to/bright-ai-plugins/cursor --approve-mcps

# Or persist approval, then run normally
cursor-agent mcp enable brightsec
cursor-agent mcp list            # check status
cursor-agent mcp disable brightsec
```

### Run in Cursor Cloud Agents

Cloud Agents are first-class — use them when the target runs in the cloud.

1. Connect the repository to Cursor Cloud Agents.
2. Create a Bright API token in Bright.
3. Add `BRIGHT_HOSTNAME` and `BRIGHT_TOKEN` to Cursor Cloud Agent **secrets**.
4. Enable the Bright MCP server for Cloud Agents, mirroring `mcp.json`:
   - Name: `brightsec`
   - Transport: HTTP
   - URL: `https://${env:BRIGHT_HOSTNAME}/mcp`
   - Header: `Authorization: Api-Key ${env:BRIGHT_TOKEN}`
5. If the app requires login, add those credentials to Cloud Agent secrets too.
6. If your team restricts cloud egress, allowlist your `BRIGHT_HOSTNAME`.

### Update

Re-index the marketplace from its Git source, then let Cursor pick up the new version:

```bash
cursor-agent plugin marketplace update brightsec
```

In desktop Cursor, a team/marketplace plugin can also be refreshed from **Customize → Plugins**
(enable **Auto Refresh** on a team marketplace to update automatically on push). For the
clone-based setups above, update by pulling the repo (`git pull`) and, for Option B, reloading the
window.

### Uninstall / disable

- **Disable or uninstall the plugin:** open **Customize → Plugins**, find **Bright Security**, and
  toggle it off or remove it.
- **Remove the marketplace source (CLI):**
  ```bash
  cursor-agent plugin marketplace remove brightsec
  ```
- **Clone-based setups:** delete the symlink `~/.cursor/plugins/local/bright-security`, or just stop
  passing `--plugin-dir`.

### Verify and troubleshoot

- **Desktop:** check `echo $BRIGHT_HOSTNAME` and `echo $BRIGHT_TOKEN` before opening Cursor chat
  tools. If Bright tools are missing, reload Cursor and confirm the **brightsec** MCP server is
  enabled in Customize.
- **Cloud Agents:** confirm `BRIGHT_HOSTNAME` and `BRIGHT_TOKEN` exist in secrets and the Bright MCP
  server is enabled in the Cloud Agent MCP UI.
- **Auth fails:** replace the API token and restart Cursor.
- **Only the Repeater fails:** test the Bright CLI manually —
  ```bash
  npx @brightsec/cli repeater --id <REPEATER_ID> --hostname "$BRIGHT_HOSTNAME" --token "$BRIGHT_TOKEN"
  ```

## Safety

Only scan targets you own or are explicitly authorized to test — a local dev server, a staging/QA
environment, or any host you're authorized to assess. DAST sends real attack traffic, so
authorization is your responsibility. Reach private or local targets through a Bright Repeater (the
agent sets one up and tears it down); publicly reachable targets can be scanned directly. Provide
credentials the way that matches your execution mode — Cloud Agent secrets for cloud, shell/user
environment variables for desktop — and never commit a `.env` with real credentials.
