# Bright Security — Claude Code plugin

Bright DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) agents and skills, packaged for Claude Code.
The plugin wires two orchestration agents and six skills to the **Bright MCP server**, so Claude
Code can analyze an app, reach a target, register attack surface, run scans, and remediate
findings — all from your terminal.

## What's inside
- **Agents** (`agents/`)
  - `bright-application-testing` — analyze the repo, reach the target, configure Bright, register
    attack surface, and run DAST scans (through a Repeater for private/local targets).
  - `bright-remediation-loop` — run DAST, apply minimal fixes, restart, and re-run validation
    scans until findings are gone.
- **Skills** (`skills/`) — `analyze-codebase`, `setup-repeater`, `setup-auth`,
  `register-entrypoints`, `run-scan`, `fix-and-validate`. The agents call these as building blocks.
- **MCP** (`.mcp.json`) — the Bright MCP server over HTTP.

---

## Install

**1. Export your Bright credentials** in the shell you launch `claude` from (the MCP server and the
Bright Repeater both read them):

```bash
export BRIGHT_HOSTNAME="app.brightsec.com"   # your Bright cluster hostname
export BRIGHT_TOKEN="your-bright-api-token"  # your Bright API token
```

Add them to `~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc` so every session has them.

**2. Install the plugin** from the marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add NeuraLegion/bright-ai-plugins
claude plugin install bright-security@brightsec
```

That's it. Verify with `claude plugin list` (should show `bright-security@brightsec → enabled`), or
inside a session run `/agents` to see the two Bright agents.

---

## Use

Ask for an agent in plain language — Claude delegates to it:

```
> Use the bright-application-testing agent to scan this app
> Use the bright-remediation-loop agent to scan, fix, and re-verify
```

Or **@-mention** it to guarantee that exact agent runs:

```
> @"bright-application-testing (agent)" scan this app
```

Or **run the whole session as the agent**, so its system prompt, tools, and model drive everything:

```bash
claude --agent bright-application-testing
```

Scan any target you own or are authorized to test (local, staging, or another authorized
environment). Reach private/local targets through a Repeater — the agent sets one up for you.

---

## Advanced usage & options

### Run a scan without permission prompts

A full scan runs many shell commands and MCP calls. To avoid approving each one, pre-allow the
Bright MCP tools plus the tools the agent needs in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agent": "bright-application-testing",
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "mcp__plugin_bright-security_brightsec__*",
      "Bash",
      "Read",
      "Write",
      "Edit"
    ]
  }
}
```

Setting `"agent"` also makes this agent the default for the project, so a bare `claude` starts as
it. `mcp__plugin_bright-security_brightsec__*` covers every Bright MCP tool (`runScan`,
`runDiscovery`, `createRepeater`, `listProjects`, …). To skip prompts entirely for a one-off run,
launch with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` instead — use it only against targets you own,
since the agent then acts fully autonomously.

### Use without installing

You can load the agents, skills, and MCP server directly from a clone — handy for trying it out,
pinning a specific commit, or air-gapped setups. `BRIGHT_HOSTNAME` and `BRIGHT_TOKEN` still need to
be exported.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeuraLegion/bright-ai-plugins
```

**Option A — drop into a project (native `--agent` support).** Copy the components into your
project's `.claude/` directory and the MCP config into the project root:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
mkdir -p .claude/agents .claude/skills
cp -r /path/to/bright-ai-plugins/claude-code/agents/*  .claude/agents/
cp -r /path/to/bright-ai-plugins/claude-code/skills/*  .claude/skills/
cp    /path/to/bright-ai-plugins/claude-code/.mcp.json .mcp.json

claude --agent bright-application-testing
```

Claude Code auto-discovers `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, and the project `.mcp.json`, so
everything is available with no marketplace install.

**Option B — attach the MCP server for a single session.** If you only need the MCP tools:

```bash
claude --mcp-config /path/to/bright-ai-plugins/claude-code/.mcp.json
```

### Update

Plugins are **not** updated automatically. Refresh the marketplace catalog, then update the plugin,
then restart Claude Code so the new version loads:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update brightsec       # fetch the latest catalog from GitHub
claude plugin update bright-security@brightsec    # update the plugin (restart required to apply)
```

Confirm with `claude plugin details bright-security@brightsec`.

If you installed **without** the marketplace (the clone approach), update by pulling the repo and
re-copying the files:

```bash
cd /path/to/bright-ai-plugins && git pull
# then re-run the cp commands from "Use without installing"
```

### Uninstall / disable

```bash
claude plugin disable bright-security@brightsec    # keep it installed but turn it off
claude plugin uninstall bright-security@brightsec  # remove the plugin
claude plugin marketplace remove brightsec         # also remove the marketplace source
```

For a clone-based setup, delete the files you copied (`.claude/agents/bright-*`,
`.claude/skills/*`, and the project `.mcp.json`).

## Safety

Only scan targets you own or are explicitly authorized to test — a local dev server, a staging/QA
environment, or any host you're authorized to assess. DAST sends real attack traffic, so
authorization is your responsibility. Reach private or local targets through a Bright Repeater
(the agent sets one up and tears it down); publicly reachable targets can be scanned directly.
